.TH GENROMFS 8
.SH NAME
genromfs \- programs to create a rom file system
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B genromfs
.I "-f outputdevice [-d sourcedirectory] [-V volumename] [-v]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The genromfs program is the 'mkfs' equivalent of the other filesystems, but
you must tell it from which directory you want to build the
filesystem.  I.e. all files (and directories) in that directory
will be part of the newly created filesystem.  Imagine it like
building a cd image, or creating an archive (tar, zip) file.
.PP
Basic Usage:
.PP
.B genromfs -d rescue/ -f /dev/fd0
.PP
All files in the rescue directory will be written to /dev/fd0 as a
new romfs filesystem image.  You can mount it (if you have the
romfs module loaded, or compiled into the kernel) via:
.PP
.B mount -t romfs /dev/fd0 /mnt
.PP
You can also set the volume name of the filesystem (which is not
currently used by the kernel) with the -V option.  If you don't
specify one, genromfs will create a volume name of the form: 'rom
xxxxxxxx', where the x's represent the current time in a cryptic
form.
.PP
All in all, it's as simple as:
.PP
.B genromfs -d rescue -f testimg.rom -V "Install disk"
